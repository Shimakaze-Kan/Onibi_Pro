# Project Journal - 2023-12-30

Zzapp! Another day of development. Today I worked on various aspects related to shipments, mainly on the frontend, fine-tuning what was already there. Added some validation to make sure no unauthorized tampering with these shipments.

On the command side, I made some changes to slim down the creation of restaurants and added a field for the regional manager. Since the regional manager has a collection of restaurant Ids, adding an Id to the collection now happens through a domain event. It might actually be a good place to add notifications, for instance, if a global manager assigns a restaurant to you when you're a regional manager.

The next task on the agenda is the entire shipment-related flowâ€”approval by the regional manager, pickup by the courier, etc. It might take a bit because I don't have the frontend or a mockup for it yet. But tomorrow (technically today since it's 12:49 AM) is New Year's Eve, and I won't deny that I have nothing else to do but continue working on this application hahaha.. ha..
