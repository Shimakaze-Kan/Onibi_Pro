# Project Journal - 2023-12-25

This is my first entry in this journal. The main goal of this project was to design an application for managing a fast-food network using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It's also my first significant encounter with DDD. In my previous work experiences, even when the idea of using DDD was raised, it often turned out that either the project wasn't suitable for it, or there wasn't enough time, leading to a single entity that no one used afterward. Therefore, I decided to give it a try on my own. I realize that there are probably many things I could do better, but for now, I'm satisfied with the progress.

Another challenge was designing the frontend in Angular, from conceptualization through wireframing to implementation. I'm very pleased with the overall look of the page. However, I noticed a tendency to constantly refine and change details on the page. I need to work on recognizing when to say "enough is enough." Nevertheless, working on this project makes me feel like a full-fledged team, even though I'm working alone. I am considering documenting the application, not in the form of a journal, but in a more organized and transparent format.

As I work on this project independently and try various things, today brought about a lot of changes. I decided that the application would have a separate database for each client. The approach involves adding a MasterDb that stores client names and user emails. During login, I can retrieve the client name to which the user belongs and include it in the token. While reading data posed no major issue, as I use Dapper, writing became a challenge. The dynamic switching of DbContexts in EF Core proved tricky. However, I managed to address this by creating a factory for DbContexts, which is used in the UnitOfWork, and using CurrentUserService to extract the name of the current client.

Dealing with the approach where each client has its own database is not new to me, having encountered it in several work projects. I deemed it appropriate to use this solution here as well. From a business perspective, adding a new client to the system won't happen too frequently, so leaving the responsibility of creating the database and other configurations to the developer seemed reasonable.

I'm eager to try out many more things in this project, but I fear it might start growing too much.
