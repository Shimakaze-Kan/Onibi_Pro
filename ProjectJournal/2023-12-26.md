In today's update, I successfully transformed the storage mechanism for "Ingredients" in the database, which are Value Objects. Previously, I serialized the list to JSON.

The new approach utilized in the MenuItem configuration:

```csharp
mib.OwnsMany(x => x.Ingredients, a =>
{
    a.ToTable("Ingredients");

    a.Property<int>("Id").ValueGeneratedOnAdd();
    a.HasKey("Id");

    a.Property(x => x.Name).HasMaxLength(100);
    a.Property(x => x.Unit).HasConversion(
        v => v.ToString(),
        v => (UnitType)Enum.Parse(typeof(UnitType), v));
    a.Property(x => x.Quantity);
});
```

Ingredients are now stored in a separate table and added each time a MenuItem is added. Since this operation won't be too frequent, this approach is acceptable. It enables retrieving a list of existing ingredients along with their unit types.

On the other hand, the old solution persists in the packages:

```csharp
pb.Property(x => x.Ingredients)
    .HasConversion(
     i => JsonSerializer.Serialize(i, new JsonSerializerOptions()),
     i => JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Ingredient>>(i, new JsonSerializerOptions()) ?? new());
```

I believe that since I still want to maintain it as a Value Object, I'll leave it as it is, and a separate service will be responsible for the correctness of ingredients. Although, I haven't implemented shipments yet, so I'm unsure of its performance.

Another point of consideration is:

```csharp
// Need this for migration
services.AddDbContext<OnibiProDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(configurationManager.GetConnectionString("SqlServerConnection")));
```

I am still figuring out how to bypass this when having a DbContext factory implemented as it currently stands.
