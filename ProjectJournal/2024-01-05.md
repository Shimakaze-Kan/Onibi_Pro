# Project Journal - 2024-01-05

A lot is happening in the project right now; the application has evolved from a simple monolith to include a notification microservice (or rather, a communication microservice).

So, the frontend can now receive notifications from the new service (via YARP). Notifications are sent using SignalR from a background worker, which checks every 5 seconds for any new notifications in the database and then sends them to users. I haven't mentioned it yet, but I'm using MongoDb as the database in this service.

Since a user can open the application in multiple browser tabs, it became necessary to store the collection of connectionIds associated with that user. Therefore, when a user connects to SignalR, their connection Id is added to their group.

```csharp
public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()
{
    Guid userId = UserIdProvider.GetUserId(Context.GetHttpContext());

    await Groups.AddToGroupAsync(Context.ConnectionId, userId.ToString());

    await base.OnConnectedAsync();
}
```

Similarly, the connectionId is removed in `OnDisconnectedAsync`.

This solves the problem of associating a specific user with their connectionId. However, because the service is a separate application, I still need to somehow retrieve the UserId from the context. To address this, the main application adds the userId in the header:

```csharp
services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromConfig(configurationManager.GetSection(ReverseProxyConfigurationKey))
    .AddTransforms(transform =>
    {
        if (transform.Route.ClusterId == NotificationsSignalRClusterId
            || transform.Route.ClusterId == NotificationApi)
        {
            transform.AddRequestTransform(async context =>
            {
                var currentUserService = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService<ICurrentUserService>();

                if (currentUserService?.CanGetCurrentUser == true)
                {
                    context.ProxyRequest.Headers.Add(ClientIdHeader, currentUserService.UserId.ToString());
                }

                await Task.CompletedTask;
            });
        }
    });
```

YARP takes care of authorization using the default policy, making everything secure.

The new application also has a controller for performing various CRUD operations on notifications. It is intended for internal use only, except for one endpoint, which retrieves all notifications for a given user. It is used at the beginning when a user logs in, and need to fetch notifications they might have missed. Therefore, YARP's configuration allows only the use of this endpoint.

```json
"notifications-route-api": {
  "ClusterId": "notifications-route-api",
  "Match": {
    "Path": "/notifications"
  },
  "Transforms": [
    {
      "PathRemovePrefix": "/notifications"
    }
  ],
  "Metadata": {
    "methods": [ "GET" ]
  }
},

[...]

"notifications-route-api": {
  "Destinations": {
    "Message/destination1": {
      "Address": "https://localhost:7171/notifications/getAll"
    }
  }
},
```

Notifications are primarily intended to be domain events, such as canceling an order or a courier picking up a package. I believe this will significantly enhance the user experience. Meanwhile, using MongoDb will relieve the relational database.

The new service doesn't seem to receive as much love as the main app, but that's just how things go.

In the upcoming plans, I need to add the ability to read notifications, i.e., change the flag indicating whether the user has read them from false to true, and also delete notifications. A more substantial topic is handling messages between users, which needs to be addressed.

That's it for today!
