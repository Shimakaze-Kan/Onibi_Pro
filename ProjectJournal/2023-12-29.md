# Project Journal - 2023-12-29

Yesterday, due to reasons beyond my control, I couldn't start coding at a reasonable hour. I finished at 2:40 AM, feeling so exhausted that the thought of updating the Project Journal didn't cross my mind. Hence, I'm catching up on it the next day.

Regarding project changes, I did a bit of remodeling in the domain. Primarily, I removed the OrderId collection from the Restaurant aggregate; now, the Order aggregate has a Restaurant Id. This change wasn't too drastic since I was already passing the Restaurant Id when creating a new order. However, it was only necessary for the domain event responsible for inserting it into the collection in the restaurant.

Additionally, I broke down the Shipment aggregate into the Package aggregate, and I moved couriers to the regional manager aggregate. This makes more sense than before because previously, I had to have one shipment record in the database that essentially did nothing. With the new concept, a courier depends on the regional manager and, consequently, the region the regional manager oversees. This aligns with the shipment flow I planned before starting the project. I still need to implement logic for creating regional managers during registration. Another task on the to-do list is adding the courier to the userType, allowing them to use the application like other users.

It's now possible to create and retrieve packages, but it still lacks a bit of polish to meet good standards.

Since I added the regional manager configuration to the database, the ManagerDetails service now also returns the regional manager to which a given manager is assigned. There is no direct relationship between the regional manager and the manager; rather, the restaurant serves as a common point for them, and relationships need to be retrieved based on that.
