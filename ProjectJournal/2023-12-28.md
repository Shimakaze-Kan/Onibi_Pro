Today I decided to undertake a refactoring effort in the contracts of my application. So far, I have organized folders representing controllers with files for requests and responses. However, I ran into a problem with classes for nested types, as shown below:

```csharp
public record GetOrdersResponse(Guid OrderId, DateTime OrderTime, bool IsCancelled, IReadOnlyList<OrderItemDtoResponse> OrderItems, decimal Total);

public record OrderItemDtoResponse(Guid MenuItemId, int Quantity, string MenuItemName, decimal Price);
```

To avoid naming collisions with other requests, I had to name it OrderItemDtoResponse. There were even more challenging cases like `CreateRestaurantEmployeePositionResponse`. To address this problem, I decided to use nested records:

```csharp
public record GetOrdersResponse(Guid OrderId, DateTime OrderTime, bool IsCancelled,
    IReadOnlyList<OrderItem> OrderItems, decimal Total)
{
    public record OrderItem(Guid MenuItemId, int Quantity, string MenuItemName, decimal Price);
};
```

Simple and clear, without comically long names, as records are nested where nothing interferes with them. A few changes in the configuration mappings, and everything was okay. Well, almost okay because Swagger struggled with having the same record names (even if they were nested and isolated from each other). Therefore, I added a new configuration to Swagger:

```csharp
c.CustomSchemaIds(type => type.FullName?.Replace('+', '_') ?? type.Name);
```

This resolves the issue, and now I can easily use swagger.json to generate clients and classes using NSwag. So far, I haven't needed to use directly nested classes in Angular, but following the convention, the generated class would be named, for example, `GetOrdersResponse_OrderItem`. Maybe not the ideal solution, but it's clear and certainly better than before.

Once again, I got deeply immersed in my work, but the good news is that I finally completed the Orders module-yay! Everything is functioning smoothly, and it looks equally good visually. Nevertheless, I've come to the realization that including the collection of OrderIds in the Restaurant aggregate was a mistake. OrderIds are added there through a domain event, and the plan was good-I even intended to turn it into a policy, where a background worker would periodically copy batches of Ids from Orders and add them to the restaurant's collection. The problem lies in the fact that EF Core will load all items when retrieving a restaurant. Considering the potentially large number of orders, I believe a better approach would be to remove this collection and simply add the Restaurant Id to the order. This will require a few changes in queries that rely on the dbo.OrderIds table, but the change seems necessary. For instance, currently, to check if a manager can cancel an order, I first need to fetch the restaurant, all OrderIds, and then check if the collection contains that specific id. The new solution will require a query that connects the order with the manager for validation on whether they can cancel the order.

Ohh and I also managed to add indexes to a few tables.

After so many hours of coding, it's time to do something else. I'd play badminton if it weren't 12:23 AM and I didn't have anyone to play with
