Today, I was writing a query to retrieve regional managers from the database, and suddenly it turned out that my request was passing to the handler, even though I provided an incorrect value in the query. It surprised me a bit why the validator wasn't catching this. My first thought was that something changed with the package updates, but that wasn't the case. Validation is done using a pipeline behavior with MediatR and looks like this:

```csharp
internal sealed class ValidationBehaviour<TRequest, TResponse>
    : IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
    where TRequest : IRequest<TResponse>
    where TResponse : IErrorOr
{
// rest of the class
```

The problem was that `TResponse` had to be `IErrorOr`. So, I had to add ErrorOr to all queries and commands to maintain consistency. This library was created in such a way that everything will work. It was a monotonous task, but I got it done.

I would add the execution plan for the old and new query for retrieving regional managers at this point, but SQL Server Management Studio doesn't have an option to export the execution plan as an image.

It turned out that the query for retrieving regional managers wasn't well-suited for filtering by parameters. So, I spent some time figuring out how to write a query that handles pagination in a way that counts all records related to a specific regional manager ID as one pagination record. In the end, I ended up with two CTEs, and the query looks like this:

```sql
WITH ManagerCountCTE AS (
    SELECT
        rm.RegionalManagerId,
        u.FirstName,
        u.LastName,
        u.Email,
        rmri.RestaurantId,
        COUNT(m.RestaurantId) OVER (PARTITION BY rm.RegionalManagerId) AS NumberOfManagers
    FROM
        dbo.RegionalManagers rm
    JOIN
        dbo.RegionalManagerRestaurantIds rmri ON rmri.RegionalManagerId = rm.RegionalManagerId
    JOIN
        dbo.Users u ON u.Id = rm.UserId
    LEFT JOIN
        dbo.Managers m ON m.RestaurantId = rmri.RestaurantId
),
FilteredManager AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY RegionalManagerId ORDER BY RegionalManagerId) AS RowNum
    FROM
        ManagerCountCTE
    WHERE
        FirstName LIKE '%' AND
        LastName LIKE '%' AND
		Email LIKE '%' AND
		RegionalManagerId LIKE '%' AND
        RegionalManagerId IN (SELECT
			RegionalManagerId
			FROM ManagerCountCTE
			WHERE RestaurantId LIKE '%e2e%')
)
SELECT
    RegionalManagerId,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    Email,
    RestaurantId,
    NumberOfManagers
FROM
    FilteredManager
WHERE
	RowNum >= @Offset AND
	RowNum <= @Offset + @PageSize - 1
```

I know it isn't the best query you have ever seen, but it gets the job done, and most importantly, it can return all records related to a regional manager when searching for a restaurant. Instead of returning a record with that specific restaurant, it returns all records associated with the regional manager who manages the restaurant. Thanks to all of this, I learned that the `DENSE_RANK()` function exists.

You can now retrieve regional managers on the frontend and search for them, but there is still no capability to create or edit them.

I'd love to do more before the end of the week, but it's Friday, and I'm writing this late at night, so I guess I should also play Touhou or something instead of coding all the time...
