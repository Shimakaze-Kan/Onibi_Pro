# Project Journal - 2024-01-01

Boom! A new year has begun ðŸŽ†. I didn't write in the journal yesterday, but that doesn't mean I did nothing, quite the opposite. Although friends on Discord were demanding attention all the time, which made things a bit clumsy. But getting to the point, I was thinking about making the shipment status change process more reliable, and I came up with the following ideas.

First I added a private class inside the Package aggregate:

```csharp
private class ShipmentStateTransition
{
    public ShipmentStatus StartState { get; }
    public ShipmentStatus EndState { get; }
    public Func<Package, bool> Condition { get; }

    public ShipmentStateTransition(ShipmentStatus startState, ShipmentStatus endState, Func<Package, bool> condition = null!)
    {
        StartState = startState;
        EndState = endState;
        Condition = condition ?? ((_) => true);
    }

    public bool CanTransition(Package package)
    {
        return Condition(package);
    }
}
```

This way, I can define something like a graph for shipment states (haven't checked if they're well-defined, though).

```csharp
new(ShipmentStatus.PendingRegionalManagerApproval, ShipmentStatus.AssignedToCourier,
    (package) => package.Courier is not null && package.Origin is not null),
new(ShipmentStatus.PendingRegionalManagerApproval, ShipmentStatus.Rejected),
new(ShipmentStatus.AssignedToCourier, ShipmentStatus.CourierPickedUp),
new(ShipmentStatus.AssignedToCourier, ShipmentStatus.Rejected),
new(ShipmentStatus.CourierPickedUp, ShipmentStatus.Delivered),
new(ShipmentStatus.CourierPickedUp, ShipmentStatus.Rejected),
```

And then, the usage looks like this:

```csharp
private bool TryChangeStatus(ShipmentStatus newStatus)
{
    var transition = _transitions.SingleOrDefault(t => t.StartState == Status && t.EndState == newStatus);
    if (transition?.CanTransition(this) ?? false)
    {
        Status = newStatus;
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

This allows changing the shipment's current state or not if it's not valid. The conditions in this graph are quite general, precise rules (e.g., whether you can assign such a restaurant as the pickup location) are inside methods. I also tweaked some method names to make more sense and split some into smaller ones.

Additionally, I added a getter that saves the states the shipment can take:

```csharp
public IReadOnlyList<ShipmentStatus> AvailableTransitions
{
    get
    {
        return _transitions.Where(transition => transition.StartState == Status)
            .Select(transition => transition.EndState).ToList();
    }
    private set { } // required by ef core
}
```

This will make frontend development easier.

Next couriers stuff.

This time, instead of setting the collection as owned, I allowed it to be a standalone entity because EF Core has some issues with setting foreign keys for owned types. From a business perspective, the Couriers collection is still dependent only on the Regional Manager, but the configuration is different. Unfortunately, it caused some problems. Since Couriers are not owned, I couldn't retrieve them back from the database. Of course, the solution is to add `.Include()`, but due to abstraction, I don't have access to the db context in the application layer. So, I solved it like this:

```csharp
public async Task<TAggregateRoot?> GetByIdAsync(TId id, CancellationToken cancellationToken, params string[] includes)
{
    var query = _dbSet.AsQueryable();

    if (includes != null)
    {
        query = query.IncludeProperties(includes);
    }

    return await query.SingleOrDefaultAsync(entity => entity.Id.Equals(id), cancellationToken);
}
```

and an extension method:

```csharp
public static class QueryableExtensions
{
    public static IQueryable<T> IncludeProperties<T>(this IQueryable<T> source, params string[] navigationPropertyPaths) where T : class
    {
        IQueryable<T> query = source;
        foreach (var navigationPropertyPath in navigationPropertyPaths)
        {
            query = query.Include(navigationPropertyPath);
        }
        return query;
    }
}
```

This way, I can include the collection in the application layer, and it's entirely optional:

```csharp
var regionalManager = await _unitOfWork.RegionalManagerRepository.GetByIdAsync(regionalManagerId, cancellationToken, nameof(RegionalManager.Couriers));
```

It might look a bit hacky, but I kinda like it.

Now, I can confirm shipments through the regional manager, but everything is still a bit scattered. Working alone has its pros and cons. The pros are that my opinion is final and undisputed, but the cons are that my opinion is final and undisputed and I can make stupid stuff, hehe.Seriously, the downside is that progress is slow. Instead of tackling one part of the system and seeing how it connects with the rest in a few days, I only move on to another part after several days, so the results take a while.

I finished coding late again (2:50 AM), but at least I took a moment to play Touhou. It gives some meaning to life.
