# Project Journal - 2024-01-06

Today, I tackled the messaging feature, and the results are quite satisfactory. In short, sending messages between logged-in users is operational. However, there are still some things to add, such as a list of users to whom you can send a message (currently hardcoded), and fixing a few bugs that have appeared. Changing the message model will also be beneficial because I cannot currently track whether someone has read a message.

In terms of general reflections, I liked MongoDB because I can modify the data structure at any time.

Additionally, today I tried to make a small revolution, namely to change the way messages are sent. Change it compared to what was already on the frontend, i.e., instead of sending messages like an email, to make it work more like the messenger on Facebook. I changed a lot of things on both the frontend and backend, but I asked myself a very important question.

### Should this application have a communicator in this style?

After that, I reverted all the changes and wrote code according to what was planned in the mockups. It took some time.

Among other things related to the code, the main application also adds the user's name in the header, which helps with handling messages. I also added a flag to disable the notification background worker because it was annoying during development.

Perhaps the communication service is not getting as much love, but such services are usually treated somewhat neglectfully. At least that's how it looked when I worked. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this service, it meets certain standards, but it's not as polished as the main application. Perhaps because the main application required more infrastructure and, therefore, different practices related to DDD, which enforced clean code. In such a small service, it's probably enough to put classes in the right folders and you're good to go.

Until tomorrow!
